# NSIDC_file_reader
Scripts for reading and exporting various National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center flat binary (.bin) data files.

Most the files comes with IDL .pro scripts to read and/or plot them, but without IDL (a closed-source programming environment), you have to just figure it out yourself. Here I provide some simple Python scripts for easily reading and exporting the data yourself. You shouldn't need to edit the files (unless you want to develop it further or work out a bug, in which case please submit a pull request!), you should just be able to run them from the command line.

Alerts or a simple thanks can be sent to Mike MacFerrin (michael.macferrin@colorado.edu).
For suggestions or bugs, please submit an Issue ticket. If you'd like to add functionality or fix a bug, please submit a pull request.
